=Project Abstract=
DNA origami has enabled manipulations of sophisticated nanoscale constructions; however, the biomedical applications of
DNA origami are not yet well explored. Quantum dots (QD) are well-known for their photostability and unique physical
properties; they can be visualized individually under fluorescence microscopy. Previous work demonstrates the
spontaneous attachment of QD onto self-assembling amyloid fibrils. In this project, self-assembling DNA origami modified
with biotins was conjugated to streptavidin-QD625, and then the complex was aligned spontaneously onto biotinylated
beta-amyloid fibrils. Each of the fibrils was clearly monitored under both fluorescence microscope and atomic force
microscope, illustrating the effective attachment of QD-functionalized DNA origami on a well-defined self-assembling
protein fibril. The whole as-prepared complex is ready to be served as biosensor for specific target molecules when a
probe is attached to the QD. It is of high potential for development in biocompatible nanomaterials to detect cellular
and molecular components, which advance clinically disease diagnosis.

Step 2. Applying streptavidin onto the nanofibril platform. Streptavidin will coat the fibril through conjugating with
biotin.

Step 3. Introducing self-assembled biotin-modified DNA origami onto the nanofibril platform. The origami will bind onto
streptavidin through the strong biotin-streptavidin interaction.

Step 4. Applying streptavidin-conjugated quantum dots onto the nanofibril platform. The quantum dot will bind onto the
DNA origami through the biotin-streptavidin conjugation.

annealing condition (see methodology). 1)100bp DNA Ladder; 2) - 9)13μM staples: 1μM scaffold; 10)100bp DNA Ladder. As is
shown in the image, excess staples were separated from the assembled origami.

==Height of nanofibril platform increased after attachment of the particles==

origami-streptavidin-conjugated biotinylated Abeta fibrils. B: Diagram demonstration of the average height after
attachment on nanofibril platform. When the platform is coated with streptavidin, DNA origami, and quantum dots, the
height significantly increased to around 7.0 nm, compared with the control (3.2 nm). *** P<0.001.==Width of nanofibril
    platform increased after attachment of the particles==[[Image:HKBU 2013 AnalW.png|center|d]] Figure 3. Average width

    origami-streptavidin-conjugated biotinylated Abeta fibrils. B: Diagram demonstration of the average height after
    attachment on nanofibril platform. When the platform is coated with streptavidin, DNA origami, and quantum dots, the
    width significantly increased to around 53 nm, compared with the control (22 nm). *** P<0.001.==Even alignment of
    the particles was observed along nanofibril platform==[[Image:HKBU 2013 AnalP.png|center|d]] Figure 4. Graphical
    analysis of the Abeta fibrils coated with the particles (cluster of streptavidin, DNA origami, and QD). As is shown
    in the result, the height of the particles attached is around the same level (4.79 nm), and the distance varied a
    little between different particles; overall, a pattern of even alignment of the particles are clearly
    demonstrated.==Less quantum dots were attached onto the DNA-coated nanofibril platform==[[Image:HKBU 2013
    AnalQ.png|center|d]] Figure 5. Less quantum dots were attached on the nanofibril platform after the treatment with
    streptavidin and DNA origami. A: FM imaging of the fibrils with different treatment; (1) Quantum dot-conjugated
    biotinylated Abeta fibrils; (2) Quantum dot-DNA origami-streptavidin-conjugated biotinylated Abeta fibrils. B:
    Diagram demonstration of the amount of quantum dots attached on the nanofibril platform under different treatment. A
    significant lower level of the amount was observed when the platform had been treated with streptavidin and DNA
    origami, which are about 350 less than the QD-conjugated fibrils. *** P<0.001.=Discussion===Yielding rate of DNA
    origami==In the experiment, around 4.35 ng/μL of DNA could be extracted out from the agarose gel, which is around
    82.65 nM according to the calculation (see Lab Logs of October). However, according to the recipes for
    self-assembling of DNA origami, the estimated yielding should be around 13 μM, much higher than the exact amount
    obtained. The low yielding rate may be caused by the inefficiency of the kit used for gel extraction. Moreover, a
    relatively low level of 260/230 was shown after the gel extraction, which is also thought to be caused by the
    remaining residue of the chemicals of the kit. Therefore, to raise the concentration of DNA origami in the future,
    alternative equipment such as Freeze n’ Squeeze column is suggested; to increase the purity of the DNA origami,
    precipitation step is necessary after the gel extraction.==Efficiency of DNA precipitation==To improve the purity of
    the DNA origami, DNA precipitation was performed (see methodology). According to the result, the amount of DNA would
    decrease by 70% to 80%, and the contaminant could be removed by around 95% in general, which reveals a high
    efficiency of purification but also a high sample loss. The loss in DNA sample may be caused during the removal of
    ethanol; however, since both AFM imaging and FM imaging showed positive results on the existence of DNA origami, the
    large amount of loss did not lead to the failure of quantum dot conjugation.==The decreased efficiency of quantum
    dot alignment==According to the results in fluorescent microscopic study, clear blinking fibril patterns were
    observed when applying onto the beta-amyloid with streptavidin (STV), DNA origami, and quantum dots (QD)
    sequentially. Nonspecific binding effects were minimized by blocking the rest space with 1% BSA solution and the
    washing using PB buffer between each step. Thus, if the QD exist, they are much more likely to connect to the DNA
    origami rather than exist everywhere, which could be confirmed from the images. However, compared with the fibril
    with QD added, less QD were found to attach onto the fibril, which is presumably caused by the repulsion effects
    between streptavidin molecules and DNA molecules. Since DNA origami are negatively charged biomolecules, they tend
    to be dispersed from each other rather than forming firm aggregates; therefore, less DNA origami can bind onto the
    streptavidin-coated nanofibril platform, thus leading to less binding of QD. The atomic force microscopic
    observation provided evidence to support the assumption of repulsion; not only the binding patterns of STV-DNA-QD
    particles along the fibrils were clearly shown, but also when comparing with the Abeta+QD sample, the STV-DNA-QD
    particles are much more bulky and dispersed. But still, the quantitative study on the interaction between
    streptavidin and DNA origami molecules need to be further analyzed in the future to deepen the understanding.

    =Potential Application=

    ==Drug delivery==

    In the next step, we hope to identify a medical substance whose chemical structure can be conjugated onto the small
    biotinylated DNA origami, and the whole as-prepared molecule can be delivered to target molecules, such as abeta
    fibrils, therefore demonstrates pharmacological effects as well as advances clinically disease treatment. This
    requires much more efforts in reading and conducting experiments, but the positive result of QD-functionalized DNA
    origami at current stage has opened up a promising future for DNA origami in the field of drug delivery.
