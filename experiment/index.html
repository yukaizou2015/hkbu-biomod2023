<h1>LAB LOGS</h1>
<h2>LATEST RESULT</h2>

<h3>October 26th</h3>

We finished the construction of wiki. The last Sunday meeting would be held tomorrow (October 27th), and we would have
rehearsal on the presentation next week before heading to Harvard. Hello Boston! :)

<h3>October 25th</h3>

We completed the t-shirt design. The contents of wiki were kept being uploaded.

<h3>October 24th</h3>

We completed the awesome 3-min video and uploaded onto YouTube.

<h3>October 21st</h3>

We recorded the audio track of the video and combined the animation with the video.

<h3>October 20th</h3>

We revised the flash animation and improved some parts of the video.

<h3>October 18th</h3>

We continued working on the animation of the academic part of the video, and we decided to modify some parts of the
video this Sunday (October 20th).

<h3>October 16th</h3>

We continued and completed the recording of the story part of the YouTube video with the help of Michael Huang. After
the recording, we discussed the academic part of the video. We expect to finish the academic part by Saturday and start
the sound recording.

<h3>October 13th</h3>

We held the 6th meeting of the semester. In the meeting, we planned the outline and distributed everyone’s role in the
presentation. We also conducted the first trial of video recording with the help of Michael Huang. We will continue the
video recording next Wednesday (October 16th)

<h3>October 10th</h3>

We conducted AFM imaging with the help of Mr. Fang Yuqiang today.

Clear Aβ fibrils were shown. In addition, we performed analysis to the images of atomic force microscope.

<h3>October 8th</h3>

We conducted FM imaging with the help of Ms. Ashley Ho today.

We analyzed the images of fluorescence microscopy, and the slides for AFM imaging were prepared.

<h3>October 7th</h3>

We contacted Michael Huang, a sophomore student major in Cinema and Television, to support the recording of the YouTube
video.

DNA samples were prepared for FM imaging on Tuesday.

<h3>October 6th</h3>

We held the fifth meeting of the semester. During the meeting, we discussed the flow and technical problems of the
YouTube video, the design of the T-shirt, the results of experiment last week. We decided to conduct experiments for one
more week to obtain some more confident results, and we were going to start the first trial of video recording next
Sunday.

<h3>October 5th</h3>

A 1.5% agarose gel electrophoresis was conducted. Photo was captured, and the target bands were excised and undergone
gel extraction according to the protocol (see methodology). After gel extraction and purification, the concentration of
DNA was determined by Nanodrop.

<h3>October 4th</h3>

A new annealing process was conducted at 17:20 today according to the parameters shown in August 23rd.

<h3>October 3rd</h3>

We conducted FM imaging with the help of Ms. Ashley Ho today.
Results of FM imaging:

<p align="center">Abeta + QD, size scale: 0.14mm X 0.14mm</p>

Clear and bright fibril patterns of QD were obtained.

<p align="center">Abeta + Streptavidin + DNA + QD, size scale: 0.14mm X 0.14mm</p>

</html>

Clear and bright fibril patterns of QD were observed, but less QD aligned. The pattern is assumed to be caused by
repulsion effect between streptavidin molecules and between DNA origami structures, which need to be supported by
evidence from AFM imaging.

Clear fibrils and STV-DNA-QD-conjugated fibrils were captured. The patterns of both “Abeta-QD” and
“Abeta-Streptavidin-DNA-QD” have been obtained. Clear decorations of "STV-DNA-QD" on the fibril can be observed, which
can be confirmed by the FM imaging, and there were less particles decorated on the streptavidin-coated Abeta fibrils
compared with the sample "Abeta-QD", which supports the assumption that when conjugating STV and DNA origami, repulsion
between these molecules reduce the number of QD attaching to the fibril. The next AFM imaging is reserved next Thursday
(October 10th).

<h3>October 2nd</h3>

Slides for AFM imaging were prepared.
