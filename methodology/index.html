        <h2>Gel Extraction</h2>
        <h3>(QIAquick Gel Extraction Kit)</h3>
        <ol class="fs-6">
            <li>Excise the DNA fragment from the agarose gel with a clean, sharp scalpel.</li>
            <li>Weigh the gel slice in a colorless tube. Add 3 volumes Buffer QG to 1 volume gel (100mg~100uL). For >2% agarose gels, add 6 volumes Buffer QG.</li>
            <li>Incubate at 50C for 10 min (or until the gel slice has completely dissolved). Vortex the tube every 2~3 min to help dissolve gel.</li>
            <li>After the gel slice has dissolved completely, check that the color of the mixture is yellow (similar to Buffer QG  without dissolved agarose). If the color of the mixture is orange or violet, add 10uL 3M sodium acetate, pH 5.0, and mix. The color of the mixture will turn yellow.</li>
            <li>Add 1 gel volume of isopropanol to the sample and mix.</li>
            <li>Place a QIAquick spin column in a provided 2ml collection tube.</li>
            <li>To bind DNA, apply the sample to the QIAquick column and centrifuge for 1 min. Discard flow-through and place the QIAquick column back into the same tube. For sample volumes of >800uL, load and spin/apply vacuum again.</li>
            <li>Add 0.5 ml Buffer QG to the QIAquick column and centrifuge for 1 min. Discard flow-through and place the QIAquick column back into the same tube.</li>
            <li>To wash, add 0.75 ml Buffer PE to QIAquick column and centrifuge for 1 min. Discard flow-through and place the QIAquick column back into the same tube.</li>
            <li>Centrifuge the QIAquick column once more in the provided 2 ml collection tube for 1 min at 17,900 * g to remove residual wash buffer.</li>
            <li>Place QIAquick column into a clean 1.5 ml microcentrifuge tube.</li>
            <li>To elute DNA, add 50uL Buffer EB (10mM Tris*Cl, pH8.5) or water to the center of the QIAquick membrane and centrifuge the column for 1 min. For increased DNA concentration, add 30uL Buffer EB tot eh center of the QIAquick membrane, let the column stand for 1 min, and then centrifuge for 1 min. After the addition of Buffer EB to the QIAquick membrane, increasing the incubation time to up to 4 min can increase the yield of purified DNA.</li>
            <li>If the purified DNA is to be analyzed on a gel, add 1 volume of Loading Dye to 5 volumes of purified DNA. Mix the solution by pipetting up and down before loading the gel.</li>
        </ol>
        
        <h3>(Nucleospin Extract II)</h3>
        <ol class="fs-6">
            <li>Excise the DNA fragment from the agarose gel using a clean scalpel.</li>
            <li>Transfer the cut portion to a clean tube and determine the weight.</li>
            <li>Add 200μL Buffer NT per 100mg agarose gel.</li>
            <li>Incubate the sample for 5-10 min at 50°C. Vortex the sample every 2-3 minutes.</li>
            <li>Load the dissolved sample into a NucleoSpin Extract II Column. Centrifuge for 1min at 11,000 rcf. Discard the flow-through.</li>
            <li>Wash the silica membrane by adding 700μL Buffer NT3 to the NucleoSpin Extract II Column. Centrifuge for 1 min at 11,000 rcf. Discard the flow-through.</li>
            <li>Dry the silica membrane through centrifugation at 11,000 rcf for 2 minutes.</li>
            <li>Elute the DNA into a new 1.5 mL microcentrifuge tube by adding 50 μL Buffer NE, incubate at room temperature for 1 minute, and centrifuge for 1 minute at 11,000 rcf.</li>
        </ol>
        
        <h2>DNA Precipitation</h2>
        <ol class="fs-6">
            <li>Add 1/10 volume of 3M sodium acetate (NaOAc) (pH 5.2) plus 2-3 volumes of cold 100% ethanol (ETOH) to the solution containing DNA.</li>
            <li>Place the solution at -20°C overnight.</li>
            <li>Centrifuge the solution at 14,00O RPM for 10-20 minutes at 4°C. Remove the ETOH and rinse the pellet with 70% ETOH.</li>
            <li>Centrifuge the re-suspended pellet again at 14000 RM for 5 minutes at 4°C. The ETOH is removed and the pellet is air-dried for about 10 min.</li>
            <li>Re-suspend the pellet for later use.</li>

        <h1>SEM imaging</h1>
        
        <hr>
        
        <p class="fs-6">SEM images were captured using LEO 1530 Field Emission SEM (Carl Zeiss, Germany). Mica sheet (Ted Pella, U.S.A.) was attached onto the holder and coated with a thin gold layer prior to the sample settlement. To achieve resolution, 20µL of the quantum dot samples were applied onto the gold-coated surface and allowed drying overnight. Before scanning, the mica sheet was mounted onto the holder using a thin carbon tape. The accelerating voltage of the SEM electron gun is 15kV, and the magnification of the images ranges from 250X to 100kX. The images were analyzed by ImageJ software.</p>
